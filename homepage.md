## Important Platform Information

### Swap Execution & Slippage Protection
**Automatic Retry System**: We automatically retry failed swaps with progressively higher slippage tolerances to ensure your trades execute successfully:
- Initial attempt: Your configured slippage (default 0.5%)
- Retry 1: 1.5% slippage
- Retry 2: 3.0% slippage
- Final retry: 5.0% slippage (maximum limit)

This protects you from missing important trades due to temporary market volatility while preventing excessive slippage losses.
